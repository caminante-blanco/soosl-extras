<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Any time you work on a computer, it is important to keep extra copies of your files. Usually people call these </span><span class="rvts51">backup copies</span><span class="rvts6">. We think it is clearer to call them </span><span class="rvts51">spare copies</span><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Why are spare copies important? Many things can go wrong and destroy your work:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">You can erase files by accident.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Someone else can erase files by accident or deliberately.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">A bug in SooSL or another program can erase or damage your files.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">The electric power can drop or surge. This can damage your files.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Your hard disk may crash and no longer work. You can lose all the files on the hard disk.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Malware might erase or encrypt your files.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Someone might steal your computer.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">A fire or flood might destroy your computer.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">How do you protect your files? You make spare copies of them before anything happens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Make many copies often.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
  <li class="rvps8 noindent"><span class="rvts12">How often? Ask yourself: How much work are you willing to lose? If you are willing to lose two weeks of work, then make spare copies every two weeks. Most people don't want to lose more than one day of work. They should make spare copies every day.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps8 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Keep more than one version of the same file. Sometimes, after you make changes to a file, you decide that you don't want those changes. With spare copies, you can then go back to an earlier version. Maybe your file gets damaged, but you don't realize it. You might make a spare copy of the damaged copy without realizing it. You may have to go back to a spare copy you made before the file was damaged.</span></li>
 </ul>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Store them in different places.</span></li>
 <ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
  <li class="rvps8 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Spare copies on your hard disk are convenient. However, if your hard disk crashes or someone steals your computer, those spare copies won't protect you. Both your main copies and the spare copies are gone.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps8 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Spare copies on an external hard disk or USB stick are better. However, if they are in the same room and there is a fire, they won't protect you. Or, if they are in the same computer bag and someone steals the whole bag, they won't protect you.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps8 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Spare copies in cloud storage (Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Carbonite) provide the best protection. However, it can be slow to make them and recover them.</span></li>
  <li class="rvps8 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Ideally, make spare copies in all three places.</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In short: many spare copies in many places.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">You can make spare copies by copying them manually. This is a problem, though: you can forget to do so. You might get tired of making them, and stop doing so. So, it is better to have an automatic backup system. There are lots of systems to choose from. Here are some ideas.</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Windows computers have a system called File History.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Mac computers have a system called Time Machine.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">A free program called </span><a class="rvts13" href="https://www.duplicati.com/" target="_blank">Duplicati</a><span class="rvts12"> works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is designed especially for remote backups (on another device or in cloud storage).</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">If you store your files in Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive, they will automatically make spare copies in the cloud. However, if you delete your local copies, this will also delete the copies in the cloud. When your local copies change, the cloud copies change too. So, this doesn't provide protection against mistakes</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">There are many other good backup programs. Ask a computer expert what they recommend..</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">For more ideas, do a web search for "Windows backup software" or "Mac backup software" or "Linux backup software".</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you don't know how to set up a backup system, find someone who does know how, who can help you.</span><span class="rvts6"></span></p>
