<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Here are short explanations of some important words that SooSL uses. If you want more explanations, use the links to other help topics.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">backup copy</span><span class="rvts83"> - see </span><span class="rvts85">spare copy</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">bilingual dictionary</span><span class="rvts83"> - a </span><span class="rvts85">dictionary</span><span class="rvts83"> of a language which has meanings represented by translations in another language. These translations are called </span><span class="rvts85">glosses</span><span class="rvts83"> or translation equivalents. Most sign language dictionaries are bilingual dictionaries. They use written words to express the meanings of the signs, usually in the national written language of the country. Most SooSL dictionaries are bilingual dictionaries, with glosses in one or more written languages.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts86">clarifying comment</span><span class="rvts6"> - a short </span><a class="rvts15" href="Newtopic1.html">comment in parentheses</a><span class="rvts6"> at the end of a </span><span class="rvts51">gloss</span><span class="rvts6"> that make its meaning clearer</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">comparative dictionary</span><span class="rvts83"> - a </span><span class="rvts85">dictionary</span><span class="rvts83"> that compares the word/signs in two or more related languages. For example, a </span><a class="rvts84" href="ComparedifferentsignlanguagesD.html">comparative dictionary</a><span class="rvts83"> of a sign language might compare the signs in ASL, Bolivian Sign Language, and Ghanaian Sign Language. It would show which signs are the same in all three languages and which signs are only in one language.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">dialect</span><span class="rvts79"> (or </span><span class="rvts85">SIGN VARIETY</span><span class="rvts79">) - Within one sign language, people in different places may use some different signs. Or different types of people may use different signs (men/women, older/younger, people who attended different schools). We use the word </span><a class="rvts84" href="Dialects.html">dialect</a><span class="rvts83"> for each of these varieties of a sign language.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">dictionary</span><span class="rvts83"> - a website or book that lists words/signs in a language and gives their meanings. Many dictionaries also tell other things about the words/signs, such as their </span><span class="rvts85">grammar category</span><span class="rvts83">, </span><span class="rvts85">dialects</span><span class="rvts83">, and examples of how they are used. There are several </span><span class="rvts83">different types</span><span class="rvts83"> of dictionaries, including </span><span class="rvts85">bilingual dictionaries</span><span class="rvts83">, </span><span class="rvts85">monolingual dictionaries</span><span class="rvts83">, and </span><span class="rvts85">comparative dictionaries</span><span class="rvts83">. You can use SooSL Desktop to </span><a class="rvts84" href="OtherwaystouseSooSLD.html">make different types of dictionaries</a><span class="rvts83"> for your sign language. You can see dictionaries that other people have made on </span><a class="rvts84" href="https://web.soosl.net" target="_blank">SooSL Web</a><span class="rvts83">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">dictionary project</span><span class="rvts83"> - In SooSL Desktop, you make a sign language dictionary inside a </span><a class="rvts84" href="ManagedictionaryprojectsD.html">dictionary project</a><span class="rvts83">. The project has </span><a class="rvts84" href="SooSLprogramandprojectfilesD.html">many different computer files</a><span class="rvts83"> for the videos and written words that are in the dictionary. Most of the time you work in an active dictionary project, but you can also </span><a class="rvts84" href="ExportadictionaryprojectD.html">export a project</a><span class="rvts83"> to a </span><span class="rvts85">ZooZL file</span><span class="rvts83">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">display language</span><span class="rvts83"> - The language that SooSL uses in its menus, dialog boxes, tooltips, etc. Sometimes called </span><span class="rvts85">interface language</span><span class="rvts83">. It can be the same as one of the written languages in a dictionary project, or different from all of them. See </span><a class="rvts84" href="Displaylanguage.html">this topic</a><span class="rvts83"> to change the display language.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">edit mode</span><span class="rvts83"> - In SooSL Desktop, you make changes to signs in </span><a class="rvts84" href="Editmodeeditsignsinadictionarypr.html">edit mode</a><span class="rvts83">. You can change the video information for a sign (</span><a class="rvts84" href="ReplaceavideoD.html">sign video</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="AddanexamplesentenceD.html">example sentences</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="AddanextravideoorimageD.html">extra videos</a><span class="rvts83">) or change the written information (</span><a class="rvts84" href="AddandeditasignssensesD.html">senses</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="EditasignsglossesD.html">glosses</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="AddanexamplesentenceD.html">example sentence translations</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="EditasensesgrammarcategoryD.html">grammar category</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="EditasensesdialectsD.html">dialects</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="EditnotesforasignD.html">notes</a><span class="rvts83">). You can tell that SooSL is in edit mode when the status bar at the bottom of the window has a red background. After you </span><a class="rvts84" href="ExiteditmodeD.html">exit edit mode</a><span class="rvts83">, you will be back in normal mode.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">example sentence</span><span class="rvts83"> - a sentence that shows an example of how a sign is used. It may show something about the meaning of the sign, where it is used in a sentence, or how it is used with other signs. Sometimes it is more than one sentence. In SooSL, </span><a class="rvts84" href="Examplesentencesandtranslations.html">example sentences</a><span class="rvts83"> are videos of someone signing, and have translations in one or more written languages.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">face/head/body</span><span class="rvts83"> (or </span><span class="rvts85">non-manual</span><span class="rvts83">) - Sign languages use hands and other parts of the body. Most signs use the hands, but may also use movements of other parts of the body, including the face and head. In SooSL we call these parts of the sign </span><a class="rvts84" href="Faceheadbodynon-manuals.html">face/head/body</a><span class="rvts83">. Usually, people call them "non-manuals", or the parts of a sign that don't use the hands. You can </span><a class="rvts84" href="IndexasignbyparametersD.html">index signs</a><span class="rvts83"> by its </span><a class="rvts84" href="IndexbyfaceheadbodyD.html">face/head/body parameters</a><span class="rvts83">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">focal dialect</span><span class="rvts78"> </span><span class="rvts79">- The main </span><a class="rvts84" href="Dialects.html">dialect</a><span class="rvts83"> </span><span class="rvts79">in a dictionary. It may be the dialect </span><span class="rvts83">where</span><span class="rvts79"> the dictionary creator is working most often. It may be the dialect that deaf people think is the best. Often it is the variety that the most people understand. Most of the signs in a dictionary will be in the focal dialect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">font</span><span class="rvts83"> - Letters and symbols are stored inside a computer with numeric codes. A font tells the computer how to draw the letter or symbol for each letter or symbol on the screen or when printing. Basically, a font is a collection of images, one for each letter or symbol. Different fonts may have the same letters and symbols, but they look a little different. It depends on the artistic design of the font. To display or print a written language with a computer, you have to use a font that contains all the letters and symbols that the language uses. If you don't have the right font for a language, some or all of the characters will display as little rectangles: </span><img alt="" style="width : 9px; height : 15px; padding : 1px;" src="lib/Misc_NoGlyph.png"><img alt="" style="width : 9px; height : 15px; padding : 1px;" src="lib/Misc_NoGlyph.png"><img alt="" style="width : 9px; height : 15px; padding : 1px;" src="lib/Misc_NoGlyph.png"><img alt="" style="width : 9px; height : 15px; padding : 1px;" src="lib/Misc_NoGlyph.png"><span class="rvts83">. Most fonts today are based on the </span><span class="rvts85">Unicode</span><span class="rvts83"> system.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">gloss</span><span class="rvts78"> </span><span class="rvts79">- The </span><span class="rvts80">word (or words) </span><span class="rvts83">that </span><a class="rvts84" href="Sensesandglosses.html">indicate the meaning</a><span class="rvts83"> </span><span class="rvts80">of a sign. Most glosses are ways that you can translate the sign into a written language.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">gloss list</span><span class="rvts80"> - the alphabetical list of glosses in SooSL that is used</span><span class="rvts83"> to </span><a class="rvts84" href="Searchbywordgloss.html">look up signs by their meaning</a><span class="rvts83">. </span><span class="rvts80">Except in smartphones, it is on the left side of the SooSL window. Some dictionaries call a list like this a "finder list", because it is a list used to find signs. It is one type of index of the signs in the dictionary.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">grammar category</span><span class="rvts80"> - Each sign belongs to</span><span class="rvts83"> a </span><a class="rvts84" href="Grammarcategories.html">grammar category</a><span class="rvts83"> </span><span class="rvts80">(noun, verb, adjective, etc.). The grammar category determines where the sign can be used in a sentence. In spoken languages, grammar categories are often called "parts of speech". That term doesn't make sense for sign languages, so we call them grammar categories. Other terms you will sometimes see are "grammatical category" or "word class". In SooSL, you</span><span class="rvts83"> can decide what </span><a class="rvts84" href="EditthelistofgrammarcategoriesD.html">grammar category labels</a><span class="rvts83"> you want to use in your dictionary</span><span class="rvts80">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">interface language</span><span class="rvts83"> - see </span><span class="rvts85">display language</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">keyboard</span><span class="rvts83"> - The word keyboard is used in two ways with computers. 1) The physical device that you type on. 2) A piece of software that translates what you type into letters and other symbols. Some languages require special software keyboards because they use letters and symbols that aren't on a normal physical keyboard. The software keyboard defines sequences of keystrokes that translate to special characters. You need to use a keyboard that matches the </span><span class="rvts85">font</span><span class="rvts83"> that you are using for the language. In SooSL, you can tell your computer </span><a class="rvts84" href="Writtenlanguages.html">what software keyboard</a><span class="rvts83"> to use for each written language.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">LAN</span><span class="rvts83"> (or </span><span class="rvts85">local area network</span><span class="rvts83">) - a way of connecting computers that allows them to share hard disk storage, printers, and other resources. Usually a LAN is inside of a single school, business, or home. Starting with version 0.9.2, SooSL Desktop allows multiple users to </span><a class="rvts84" href="Worktogetheronadictionaryproject.html#LAN">share access to a dictionary project</a><span class="rvts83"> through a LAN.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts85">lexicography</span><span class="rvts83"> - the science of making good dictionaries. To learn about lexicography and make your sign language dictionary better, see </span><a class="rvts84" href="LexicographyD.html">these resources</a><span class="rvts83">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">local area network</span><span class="rvts83"> - see </span><span class="rvts85">LAN</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">index a sign</span><span class="rvts80"> - </span><span class="rvts83">When you </span><a class="rvts84" href="IndexasignbyparametersD.html">index a sign</a><span class="rvts83"> in SooSL, you identify its most important </span><a class="rvts84" href="Signparameters.html">parameters</a><span class="rvts83">. </span><span class="rvts80">That way, people can find it easily. </span><span class="rvts83">They can </span><a class="rvts84" href="Searchbyparameter.html">search for it</a><span class="rvts83"> by</span><span class="rvts80"> handshape, location, etc.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">meaning category</span><span class="rvts83"> - &nbsp;Many printed sign language dictionaries group signs according to their meaning. For example, they may have one section for food, others for animals, people, tools, school, work, etc. Each of these groups of signs can be called a "meaning category". Often, they are called "semantic categories". SooSL doesn't have a good way of keeping track of meaning categories yet. You can, if you want, </span><a class="rvts84" href="Meaningcategories.html">use the dialects feature</a><span class="rvts83"> for this purpose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">monolingual dictionary</span><span class="rvts83"> - a dictionary of a language which describes the meanings of a word (sign) using other words (signs) in the same language. The descriptions of the meanings are called "definitions". Most major written languages have monolingual dictionaries. Most dictionaries of sign languages are not monolingual dictionaries. Instead, they are </span><span class="rvts85">bilingual dictionaries</span><span class="rvts83">, in which the meanings are expressed with </span><span class="rvts85">glosses</span><span class="rvts83"> in a written language. You can use SooSL to </span><a class="rvts84" href="ProvidemeaningsinasignlanguageD.html">make a monolingual dictionary</a><span class="rvts83">, but SooSL is primarily designed for making bilingual dictionaries.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">mouth gesture</span><span class="rvts83"> - a movement of the mouth that is not borrowed from a spoken language. In SooSL, you can </span><a class="rvts84" href="IndexbyfaceheadbodyD.html#Mouth">index signs by mouth gestures</a><span class="rvts83">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">mouth morpheme</span><span class="rvts83"> - a </span><span class="rvts85">mouth gesture</span><span class="rvts83"> that has a specific meaning by itself. It is not connected to a specific sign, but can be used with several different signs, to modify their meaning.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">mouthing</span><span class="rvts83"> - a movement of the mouth that is borrowed from a spoken language. Usually mouthings are "speaking" a word that means the same thing as the sign. The "speaking" may be with voicing or silent. Sometimes people say the whole word, sometimes just part of the word.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">neutral space</span><span class="rvts83"> - Some signs are made with the hands touching or close to a part of the body. Other signs are made with the hands in front of the body, not anywhere close. We say that the </span><a class="rvts84" href="Locations.html">location</a><span class="rvts83"> of these other signs is in neutral space. When a sign is in neutral space, we don't </span><a class="rvts84" href="IndexbylocationD.html">index it by location</a><span class="rvts83">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">non-manual </span><span class="rvts83">- see </span><span class="rvts85">face/head/body</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">normal mode</span><span class="rvts83"> - the normal way of interacting with SooSL when you are reading a dictionary. SooSL Web always operates in normal mode. SooSL Desktop </span><a class="rvts84" href="NormalmodeD.html">starts in normal mode</a><span class="rvts83">, but you can </span><a class="rvts84" href="Editmodeeditsignsinadictionarypr.html">switch</a><span class="rvts83"> to </span><span class="rvts85">edit mode</span><span class="rvts83"> to make changes. You can tell you are in normal mode in SooSL Desktop when the status bar at the bottom of the SooSL window has a white background.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">parameters of a sign</span><span class="rvts81"> </span><span class="rvts80">- </span><a class="rvts84" href="Signparameters.html">Parameters</a><span class="rvts83"> are the different "parts" of a sign: </span><a class="rvts84" href="Majorsigntypes.html">sign type</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="Handshapes.html">handshapes</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="Locations.html">location</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="Motion.html">motion</a><span class="rvts83">, and </span><a class="rvts84" href="Faceheadbodynon-manuals.html">movements of the face, head and body (non-manuals)</a><span class="rvts83">. All together, they describe how to make the sign.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">project</span><span class="rvts83"> - see </span><span class="rvts85">dictionary project</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">project ID</span><span class="rvts83"> - a unique identifier that SooSL assigns to a </span><span class="rvts85">dictionary project</span><span class="rvts83">. It is used to identify different versions of the same dictionary project, whether they are set up as regular dictionary folders or stored in </span><span class="rvts85">ZooZL files</span><span class="rvts83">. SooSL uses this information when displaying other versions of the same dictionary in file dialogs and when uploading a dictionary to SooSL Web.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">sense</span><span class="rvts80"> -</span><span class="rvts83"> A </span><a class="rvts84" href="Sensesandglosses.html">sense</a><span class="rvts83"> represents one meaning of a sign and one way to use it.</span><span class="rvts80"> A sign may have more than one sense. Each sense represents a different meaning. A sense has one or more glosses that represent that meaning, in one or </span><span class="rvts83">more </span><a class="rvts84" href="Writtenlanguages.html">written languages</a><span class="rvts83">.</span><span class="rvts80"> </span><span class="rvts83">To show how to use the sign, a sense has a </span><a class="rvts84" href="Grammarcategories.html">grammar category</a><span class="rvts83">, </span><a class="rvts84" href="Dialects.html">dialect</a><span class="rvts83"> information, and one or more </span><a class="rvts84" href="Examplesentencesandtranslations.html">example sentences</a><span class="rvts83">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">SIGN VARIETY</span><span class="rvts83"> - see </span><span class="rvts85">dialect</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">SignWriting</span><span class="rvts83"> - a special writing system for writing sign languages. Unlike many writing systems that have been proposed for sign languages, a) it is designed for writing full texts (stories, blogs, etc.), not just individual words, b) it is intended for use by ordinary people, not just linguists, and c) it can be used with any sign language. Deaf and hearing people worked together to develop it. You can read more about it at </span><a class="rvts84" href="http://signwriting.org" target="_blank">signwriting.org</a><span class="rvts83">. If you know SignWriting, you can use it in SooSL for </span><a class="rvts84" href="Searchbyparameter.html">searching</a><span class="rvts83"> and </span><a class="rvts84" href="IndexbyhandshapeD.html">indexing</a><span class="rvts83"> by </span><a class="rvts84" href="Handshapes.html">handshape</a><span class="rvts83">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">spare copy</span><span class="rvts83"> (or </span><span class="rvts85">backup copy</span><span class="rvts83">) - Computer files are easily damaged. To protect your work, you need to </span><a class="rvts84" href="Keepsparecopiesbackupsofdictiona.html">make spare copies</a><span class="rvts83"> of all your files often. We call these copies "spare copies". Many people call them "backup copies". One way to make a spare copy of your </span><span class="rvts85">dictionary project</span><span class="rvts83"> is by </span><a class="rvts84" href="ExportadictionaryprojectD.html">exporting</a><span class="rvts83"> it to a </span><span class="rvts85">ZooZL file</span><span class="rvts83">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts85">strong side</span><span class="rvts83"> and </span><span class="rvts85">weak side</span><span class="rvts83"> - Some people are right-handed, some are left-handed. In sign languages, right-handed people use their right hand more than their left hand, and left-handed people use their left hand more. Sometimes people switch sides. Whichever hand a person is using more, we call that side of the body their strong side. We call the other side their weak side. In SooSL, the </span><a class="rvts84" href="Locations.html">body map</a><span class="rvts83"> shows the strong and weak sides for a right-handed signer. If you are left-handed, just look at the body map as if you are looking in a mirror.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">Unicode</span><span class="rvts83"> - In computers, letters and symbols are represented inside the computer with numeric codes. There are many different systems for representing letters and symbols with these codes, but the most common one today is called </span><a class="rvts84" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode" target="_blank">Unicode</a><span class="rvts83">. Unicode includes codes for the letters in most of the world's written languages, plus other characters and symbols. It even includes codes for all </span><span class="rvts85">SignWriting</span><span class="rvts83"> symbols. There are many </span><span class="rvts85">fonts</span><span class="rvts83"> and </span><span class="rvts85">keyboards</span><span class="rvts83"> that are designed using Unicode. We recommend that you use a Unicode font and keyboard for the written languages in SooSL.</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">weak side</span><span class="rvts83"> - see </span><span class="rvts85">strong side</span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts82">ZooZL file</span><span class="rvts83"> - In SooSL Desktop, you can </span><a class="rvts84" href="ExportadictionaryprojectD.html">export</a><span class="rvts83"> a </span><span class="rvts85">dictionary project</span><span class="rvts83">, which means packing all the files for the project into a single file.
