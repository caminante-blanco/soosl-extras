<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">Before you start a new dictionary, you should plan some things. You should </span><span class="rvts6">decide what you want in it. Ask yourself these questions:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><a class="rvts13" href="Decidewhatyouwantinthedictionary.html#Who">Who</a><span class="rvts12"> will use the dictionary?</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><a class="rvts13" href="Decidewhatyouwantinthedictionary.html#WhatType">What type</a><span class="rvts12"> of dictionary do they need?</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><a class="rvts13" href="Decidewhatyouwantinthedictionary.html#HowMany">How many signs</a><span class="rvts12"> do you want to include?</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><a class="rvts13" href="Decidewhatyouwantinthedictionary.html#WrittenLanguages">What written languages</a><span class="rvts12"> do your users read?</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><a class="rvts13" href="Decidewhatyouwantinthedictionary.html#Dialects">What dialects</a><span class="rvts12"> do you want to include?</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><a class="rvts13" href="Decidewhatyouwantinthedictionary.html#OtherInformation">What other information</a><span class="rvts12"> about signs do your users need?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Read below for more details about these questions.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps4"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts11">Start simple</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">Be careful what you plan in your dictionary. SooSL makes it easy to add a lot of information about each sign. It may seem easy to add new information. However, if you add lots of information to all the signs in a big dictionary, it can be a lot of work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">The more signs there are, the more work you will have. Maybe it takes just five minutes to add a note to a sign. But be careful! If you want 2000 signs with notes, that's over a month of work full time. Adding a good example sentence can take 30-60 minutes per sign. For 2000 signs, that's 1000-2000 hours of work.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">It is better to start with a small, simple dictionary and share it with people soon. You can add more signs later. You can add more information about each sign later. If you try to start with a large dictionary with lots of details about each sign, you may work for years before people can use any of it. You may never finish.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">It is better to start small and simple. Publish your dictionary soon, and let people use it. Get suggestions from them. Then you can make it bigger and better.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps4"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts23">Who</span></span><a name="Who"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts23"> will use the dictionary?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">Suppose you want deaf people to learn a written language. If so, be sure to index the signs by parameters. You want people to be able to look up a sign even if they don't know the written word. Maybe you should also include extra videos that explain how to use the written words.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">Suppose you want hearing parents to learn to sign with their deaf children. If so, include signs that parents often use with children. Be sure to give more than one written word for a sign. That way, parents can find signs more easily. Maybe you should include written notes that explain how a sign is used, especially if it is different from the written word.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">Suppose your users are people in just one group or organization. Include all the special signs they use.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">Do you need to prove to people that the sign language is a real language, so the government will recognize it? If so, you should include multiple written words for signs that mean many things. You should also include multiple signs for the same written word. You can use example sentences to show how the grammar is different.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">Is the dictionary just for people in one country, or do you want foreigners to use it too?</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">In other words, think about your users as you read the next sections. What do your users need?</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps4"><a name="WhatType"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts23">What type of dictionary do your users need?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">A dictionary can be for general use by most people or it can have a special purpose.</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">A general-purpose dictionary includes signs that everyone uses. It includes ordinary signs for people, food, daily activities, body parts, jobs, etc. It can be small, with just a few hundred of the most common signs, or it can have several thousand signs.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">A special-purpose dictionary includes signs about a specific subject. Here are some examples:</span></li>
 <ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 48px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: circle;">
  <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Science</span></li>
  <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Medicine</span></li>
  <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Design</span></li>
  <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Linguistics</span></li>
  <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Biblical and religious terms</span></li>
  <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Name-signs of people in an organization</span></li>
  <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Name-signs of places in a country</span></li>
 </ul>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">Most sign language dictionaries are </span><span class="rvts43">bilingual</span><span class="rvts12">: they give meanings in a </span><a class="rvts13" href="Writtenlanguages.html">written language</a><span class="rvts12">. You can also make a </span><a class="rvts13" href="ProvidemeaningsinasignlanguageD.html">monolingual dictionary</a><span class="rvts12">, one that has definitions in the sign language.</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts12">A comparative dictionary compares the signs of </span><a class="rvts13" href="ComparedifferentsignlanguagesD.html">two or more sign languages</a><span class="rvts12">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">What kind of dictionary do your users need?</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps4"><a name="HowMany"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts23">How many signs do you want in the dictionary?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">Dictionaries can be small or large.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts20">A special-purpose dictionary may have just 100-200 signs.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts20">In a general-purpose dictionary, first editions sometimes have just a few hundred signs. Later editions may have 2000-4000 signs, sometimes many more.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">Think about how many signs your users need. Start small, publish your dictionary, get feedback on it, then you can expand it later.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps4"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts23">What </span></span><a name="WrittenLanguages"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts23">written languages do your users read?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps18"><span class="rvts6">SooSL uses </span><a class="rvts15" href="Writtenlanguages.html">written languages</a><span class="rvts6"> for </span><span class="rvts22">the meanings of signs, for translations of example sentences, and for notes.</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts20">Usually you will want to use the national language of the country where the sign language is used. In Brazil, use Portuguese. In Thailand, use Thai. In Italy, use Italian.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts20">Some dictionaries include more than one language. Some countries use two different national languages. For example, in Rwanda, you might include both Kinyarwanda and English. If you want foreigners to use the dictionary, include English or some other major language, like Spanish, French, Arabic, or Chinese.&nbsp;</span></li>
 <li class="rvps5 noindent"><span class="rvts20">Some dictionaries may need to include the same written language twice, in two different scripts. For example, if you include Arabic, you might want to write it both in Arabic script and in Latin script. In SooSL, treat different scripts as different written languages.</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 class="rvps4"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts23">What dialects</span></span><a name="Dialects"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts23"> of the sign language do your users need to see?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Signs vary in a language. Different people use different signs. These different ways of signing are called </span><a class="rvts15" href="Dialects.html">dialects</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Do you want to use all the different signs people use in a country? Or just one standard sign for a given meaning? Or just the signs used in one place?</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you want to respect all the signs people use, it is good to include signs from different dialects. However, some people want to promote just one standard way of signing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">If you include signs from many dialects, you need to pick one as the primary dialect. In SooSL, we call it the </span><span class="rvts51">focal dialect</span><span class="rvts6">. Usually, this is the dialect that most people understand, even if they don't sign that way themselves. It may be the dialect in the capital city. It may be the dialect of a specific deaf school.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts22">If you include signs from other dialects, you need to decide if you want to include as many signs as possible, or just a few important ones.</span></p>
<h1 class="rvps4"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts23">What other</span></span><a name="OtherInformation"></a><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts23"> information about signs do your users need?</span></span></h1>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Will people need to look up signs by handshape, location or other parameters? If so, plan to </span><a class="rvts15" href="IndexasignbyparametersD.html">index</a><span class="rvts6"> the signs.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Do signs have different meanings? If so, plan to include </span><a class="rvts15" href="Sensesandglosses.html">multiple senses</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Does the written language have different ways to say the same meaning? If so, plan to include </span><a class="rvts15" href="Sensesandglosses.html">multiple glosses</a><span class="rvts6"> for each sense.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Do people need examples of how to use a sign? If so, plan to include </span><a class="rvts15" href="Examplesentencesandtranslations.html">example sentences</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Do people need to learn the grammar of the sign language? If so, plan to include </span><a class="rvts15" href="Grammarcategories.html">grammar categories</a><span class="rvts6"> and </span><a class="rvts15" href="Examplesentencesandtranslations.html">example sentences</a><span class="rvts6">. You may also want to write a grammar for people to use with the dictionary.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Are some signs hard to explain with just glosses? If so, plan to include </span><a class="rvts15" href="Notes.html">notes</a><span class="rvts6"> or </span><a class="rvts15" href="Extravideosandimages.html">extra videos and images</a><span class="rvts6">; </span><a class="rvts15" href="Examplesentencesandtranslations.html">example sentences</a><span class="rvts6"> can also help.</span></p>
