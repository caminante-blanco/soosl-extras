SooSL 0.9.4
====================================================
Windows (7 --> 11)
macOS (Sierra 10.12 --> Sequoia* and beyond???)
Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa --> Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat and Debian Trixie)**
----------------------------------------------------
*(Both Intel and ARM - with Rosetta)
** If Linux not available at time of Windows and macOS releases, it will soon follow...
  Possibly other Debian and Ubuntu based releases, but untested...
----------------------------------------------------

SooSL enables you to make a dictionary of any sign language using videos.
It also serves as a viewer for the dictionaries it creates.
  
In SooSL, you can index signs so you can find them later by handshape, location, etc. 
You don’t have to know the written word for the sign.
SooSL uses many icons and only uses written text in one menu and a few dialogue boxes. 
This makes it easier to use for users who don’t know English. 
The small amount of written text is available in French, Spanish and Romanian in addition to English. 
(If you want other languages, contact us!)

This is a beta version of SooSL software. It can be used to do real work, but we're
still working on significant design changes, so expect future versions to be somewhat different. 
We will work hard to migrate your data from one beta version to the next.

Installation instructions
=========================
If you already have SooSL installed there is no need to uninstall or remove it.
(Windows exception: If you want to install to a different location than before,
 then you will need to uninstall it first.)
If SooSL is currently running, close it before proceeding with installation.
SooSL will remember your old settings along with the locations of any project files.

Windows
-------------------------
1. Download 'SooSL-<<version>>-win32.exe' from www.soosl.net/software.html.
2. Save the file to your downloads folder.    
3. Double-click on the .exe file to run the installer program.    
4. Follow the instructions. 

For "silent" installation under Windows, run the installer in a command prompt window with either the "/SILENT" or "/VERYSILENT" command line parameter. For more information about these command line parameters and others that may be useful, see: https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setupcmdline.
    
macOS
-------------------------
 1. Download 'SooSL-<<version>>-macos.pkg' from www.soosl.net/software.html.
 2. Locate this file and double-click on it to open if it does not automatically open and begin installation.

Linux
-------------------------
Linux is now available in the packages.sil.org repositories and is installable
through your usual package management software. Wasta-Linux has these repositories
available by default; other Ubuntu users may need to enable them following the 
instructions at: http://packages.sil.org. Additionally, Debian users may need to 
edit the SIL repository in "Software & Updates" to include "contrib":
"http://packages.sil.org/debian trixie main contrib".

If you've never installed SooSL before, SooSL "may" not start on your first attempt, but please try again, as it probably will run on your second try.
If your Debian version is older than "Trixie", one of the earlier Ubuntu versions "may" work for you.
For Debian "Bookworm (12)" try Ubuntu "Jammy (22.04)"; for Debian "Bullseye (11)" try Ubuntu "Focal (20.04)". 


Downloading and installing a demo sign language project

a. Download a demo project from www.soosl.net for your version of SooSL.
b. Start SooSL     
c. Click the blue spanner/wrench icon (top right) & click "Import Project"     

[Note: If the demo project does not immediately open in SooSL, click the

 Highlight the project name you want and click "Ok".]
