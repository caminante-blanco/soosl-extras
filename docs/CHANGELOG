- Web version has been launched (soosl.net/web), providing a path to dictionary publishing online. 
  Contact us if you are interested.
- Sign data storage was changed from a SQLite database to JSON text file, making it easier to share data 
  with the web version and laying the foundation for further collaborative uses.
- Major version change from 0.8.10 to 0.9.0 due to change from SQLite to JSON.
  Older projects will update to work with this version of SooSL, but new projects will not work with older versions.
- A project ID was added to the data stored about a project. It is created using the name given to the 
  project when it was first created. This is used to identify the project and to name its directory structure.
  It will remain unchanged even if a project is renamed, copied, imported or exported.
- The name of the sign language for the project is now recorded when the project is created; 
  previously it was only available as part of the project name, and then only if the creator remembered to include it.

  opening an old project in order to add the sign language name.

  project was last changed; also shows whether or not a project can be edited (locked/un-locked icon).

  project or make a new copy. The option to rename a project on import by manually renaming .zoozl file has been removed.

  infection in previous versions of SooSL [Windows].
