soosl (0.9.0.4-1ubuntu2) SOOSLDISTRIB; urgency=medium

  * Added
   - Web version has been launched (soosl.net/web), providing a path to dictionary publishing online. 
     Contact us if you are interested.
   - A project ID was added to the data stored about a project. It is created using the name given to the 
     project when it was first created. This is used to identify the project and to name its directory structure.
     It will remain unchanged even if a project is renamed, copied, imported or exported.
   - The name of the sign language for the project is now recorded when the project is created; 
     previously it was only available as part of the project name, and then only if the creator remembered to include it.
     There is a new field in the 'Create New Project' dialog for this purpose; also a new small dialog appears when 
     opening an old project in order to add the sign language name.
   - Dialogs for opening projects have been improved to show the project name, file name, file size and date when the 
     project was last changed; also shows whether or not a project can be edited (locked/un-locked icon).
   - When importing an existing project, there is an option to change the project directory, replace the old copy of the 
     project or make a new copy. The option to rename a project on import by manually renaming .zoozl file has been removed.
   - Projects can now be renamed through the 'About project' option in the tools menu. (This does not affect the filename.)
     The filename for a copy is programmatically generated based on the project ID. (The project ID remains unchanged.)
   - Some formatting can now be added to a project's description using html through the 'About project' option.
   - Sign counts have been added for indexing by location.
   - Improved error detection, reporting and recovery; crash detection now works again.
   - Cancel button added to startup dialog.
   - 'Close project' option added to the tools menu.
  * Changed
   - Sign data storage was changed from a SQLite database to JSON text file, making it easier to share data 
     with the web version and laying the foundation for further collaborative uses.
   - Major version change from 0.8.10 to 0.9.0 due to change from SQLite to JSON.
     Older projects will update to work with this version of SooSL, but new projects will not work with older versions.
   - Amendments and fixes to program code to accommodate the change to JSON file format.
   - Fixed interface translations for Romanian.
